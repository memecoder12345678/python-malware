## Usage
To use this tool, you need to provide the target's IP address, username, and a password list file. These parameters can be passed directly from the command line.

python PSBF.py ip=<IP Address> user=<Username> wordlist=<Path to password list file>
```

```bash
python PSBF.py 192.168.1.100 admin C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\passwords.txt
```

## Features
- Automatically attempts to connect to an SMB server based on the provided IP address and username.
- Uses a password list to brute-force the connection.
- Displays a success message when a connection is successfully established.

## Encoding & Notes
