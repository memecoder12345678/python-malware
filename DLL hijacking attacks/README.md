## Introduction
This file is a simulation of a DLL Hijacking attack. This attack occurs when an application does not correctly identify the location of a dynamic link library (DLL) and loads a malicious DLL instead of the legitimate one.

## DLL File
The `Malicious_DLL.cp312-win32.pyd` file is created from Python code using Nuitka and simulates a DLL hijacking attack. When the DLL file is loaded into an application, it will display a warning message box.

## Renaming the DLL File
You can rename the `Malicious_DLL.cp312-win32.pyd` file to whatever DLL file name you desire (e.g., `your_desired_name.dll`). Ensure that the new file name does not conflict with other valid DLL files that the application may need.

## How to Use
1. Place the `Malicious_DLL.cp312-win32.pyd` file in the target Python application's directory.
2. Run the target Python application. When the application attempts to load the DLL, the message box will display a notification from the malicious DLL.

## Note
- This file only be used with Python applications and for educational purposes or network security testing. It should not be used for malicious or unauthorized purposes.
- Ensure that you have permission to use and test the application you are experimenting with.

## Additional Information
- Documentation on DLL hijacking attacks can be found in various network security resources.
- For more details on creating DLLs using Nuitka, refer to the Nuitka documentation.
